Custom New Tab Start Page
-------------------------

Used as an alternative to a bookmarks bar or bookmarks manager.

I use this page mostly for work and therefore there are usually a lot more links which I have removed.

The idea came from [/r/StartPages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/). This comes from a redditor's pre-existing design on that subreddit.

I have forgotten where I shamelessly stole this from (Please let me know so I can give credit!) and modified it very slightly for myself.

Best used in conjunction with something like [Custom New Tab URL Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia)
